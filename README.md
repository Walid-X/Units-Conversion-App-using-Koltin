# Unit-Conversion-App-using-Koltin
This project marks a significant milestone in my journey of learning the Kotlin language. The application I've developed serves as a versatile unit converter, handling conversions across weight, distance, and temperature units. On the weight front, the converter adeptly deals with two distinct units: kilograms (Kg) and pounds (Lb). Moving on to distance, it supports an impressive array of four units: yards, kilometers (Km), miles, and meters. Additionally, for temperature conversions, the converter caters to three diverse units: Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.
